# Hubezorgd
Hubezorgd is a modular, event-driven food takeaway application built with technologies such as Java Spring Boot and
RabbitMQ and hexagonal architectures. This project was originally an assignment for the backend specialization at the
University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (Hogeschool Utrecht, HU), but has been expanded and refactored.
